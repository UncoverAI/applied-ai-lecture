Code examples for the lecture

## Recommended Prerequisites
1. Be motivated
2. Be prepared to setup your IDE to develop Python.
3. Check out this [video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&si=qIJzZmIrt7hAO8Fn) to get an understanding of Deep Learning and Transformers.
4. If you want to know how to code Neural Networks from scratch, here is a [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/scaomath/simple-neural-network-for-mnist-numpy-from-scratch) to code along.
5. State of the art computer vision model convolutional neiral networt (CNN): [github](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/)

## Requriements
- Python & Notebooks
- VM in any cloud
- Install Docker
- Create base image on DockerHub


LLM (OpenAi Cloud Azure) + Language Generation + Build Agent  -->   Implement Agents at Home

1. CV (CNN) & NLP (LLM) Basics 
    - Show some basics, explain what's happening
2. LLM - Notebook (Repetition from LLM from Video -> What are Transformers & Attention for Language Generation)
3. LLM - Building an Application (Agents - Reason & Act -> Combining LLMs with code)
4. Vision Transformer
5. Multi modal models
6. Bring it together -> VL Agent ()
    - RAG -> Ingestion (Notebook) & Retrieval (part of agent) Pipeline
    - Agent Definition -> students then code it
7. A System Architecture
    - Cloud Databases, Hosting a UI, Scaling, Deployment & Monitoring?
8. Training a CNN (CNN still state of the art) 
    - Train / Fine-tune model to detect any object on an image
9. Fine-tuning an LLM (RNN, LSTM are shit, but LLMs are huge)
    - Quantization / LoRA -> Models are too big & GPUs too expensive
10. System Architecture Done in the cloud
    - Host Vector DB, Host Embedding Model, Host App, Use Model API
