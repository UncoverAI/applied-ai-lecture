Code examples for the lecture

## Recommended Prerequisites
1. Be motivated
2. Be prepared to setup your IDE to develop Python.
3. Check out this [video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&si=qIJzZmIrt7hAO8Fn) to get an understanding of Deep Learning and Transformers.
4. If you want to know how to code Neural Networks from scratch, here is a [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/scaomath/simple-neural-network-for-mnist-numpy-from-scratch) to code along.
5. State of the art computer vision model convolutional neural network (CNN): [github](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/)

## Requriements
- Python & Notebooks
- VM in any cloud
- Install Docker
- Create base image on DockerHub

## Content

(These are not single lecture units rather logical seperation of content)

1. Local LLM App with Python (Python + Streamlit + Ollama)
2. Deep Learning basics with Computer Vision (Pytorch+NeuralNets+MNIST)
3. Language Model Basics (Transformer + Attention)
4. Advanced LLM Apps (AI Agents + Retrieval Augmented Generation)
5. Advanced Deep Learning with LLMs (Fine-Tuning LLMs with 7B+ params)
6. Deployment & OPS (Cloud, Docker, CICD & GPUs)
7. Vision Transformer & Multi modal models
8. Bring it together -> Vision Language Agent with RAG as service
9. Advanced System Architecture (Host Vector DB, Host Embedding Model, Host App, Use Model API)

## Evaluation

- Group Project to build & deploy an LLM App or tuning & evaluation pipeline (16 - 32 hours work?)
    - App can advanced RAG ChatBot
    - App can be AI Agent
    - Pipeline can use LLM, GPU & advanced dataset
    - Pipeline can use VLM & GPU & standard dataset
